*QuiverCombinatoricsTools* is a SageMath package that adds combinatorial functions to *QuiverTools* to calculate symplectic leaves of quiver varieties. It adds on to the QuiverTools package written by Pieter Belmans, Hans Franzen and Gianni Petrella, as seen [here](https://sage.quiver.tools/) and [here](https://github.com/QuiverTools/QuiverTools).

# Instructions

To install it, make sure you have both QuiverTools and QuiverCombinatoricsTools
```
sage --pip install git+https://github.com/QuiverTools/QuiverTools.git
sage --pip install git+https://github.com/QuiverCombinatoricsTools/QuiverCombinatoricsTools.git
```
and then you can simply run
```
from quiver import *
from quivercombinatorics import *
```
to get started.

Alternatively, you can run it from your browser in a notebook here using [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QuiverCombinatoricsTools/QuiverCombinatoricsTools/main?filepath=notebooks/example.ipynb).
